# Lua_Scripts
A few Lua scripts I'm using for expedite my work. Mostly related to my work in developing X-Plane flight simulator (http://x-plane.com) addons, but can be used for any suitable purpose.

You can find a short description of what each script does at the top of each file.

Requirements:
- Lua 5.2 installed in your machine. Refer to https://www.lua.org/download.html to install it for your system.
- A bit of knowledge of terminal usage.

Note: Developed and tested for Unix systems (aka Linux and Mac OS). Probably windows will be supported in the future.
