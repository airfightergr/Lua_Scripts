These are bash files for use in Linux.

By adding in Terminal the command:

$ chmod +x ./add_line

you can make it executable in terminal, and run it by typing directly the command:

$ ./add_line

Moreover, with the command:

$ sudo cp add_line /usr/local/bin

you can make the add_line executable directly from terminal, from any place... like the normal shell commands.
